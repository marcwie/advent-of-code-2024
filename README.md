# Advent of Code 2024
Its that time of the year again. All solutions use only the Python Standard Library and no external dependencies. 

## Usage
- Download the input/test files to your local disk.
- For most days you can simply type ```python3 dayXX.py PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE```.
- Day 14 and 18 are a notable exceptions due to the nature of the puzzles, see ```python dayXX.py --help``` for details.
