# Advent of Code 2024
Its that time of the year again. All solutions use only the Python Standard Library and no external dependencies. 

## Usage
- Download the input/test files to your local disk.
- Type ```python dayXX.py --help``` for usage instructions.
- For most days you can simply type ```python dayXX.py PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE```. Day 14 is a notable exception, see ```python day14.py --help``` for details.
